<p>Idea 2 (Click to enlarge the picture)</p>
<a href="Homepage/Flowchart%20version%202.png"><img src="Homepage/Flowchart%20version%202.png" alt="Flowchart 2" width="1000" height="500"/></a>
<p>Idea 3</p>
<img src="Homepage/Flowchart version 3.png" alt="Idea3" width="800" height="400"/>
<p>We chose idea 2 flowchart because it directly lead people to go to sign up page from the homepage.
  However, this flowchart has too much detail, so I made a simplified flowchart.</p>
