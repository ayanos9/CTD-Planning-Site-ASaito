    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>We met most of the success criteria but not all because we made some changes.</p>
    <p>We showed our final website to Ms. Salma and these are the feedback we got from her:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set the maximum numbers of participants for each event</li>
      <li>We should allow other students to add pictures</li>
      <li>Service page is a good idea</li>
      <li>How to update the events? How can people from CS club edit events page from now on?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From now on, we need to consider how to update volunteer events.
      Currently, we only have an idea that someone in the club need to edit html file to update.</p>
